<h1> The <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> is a program that runs in front of a UCSPI-compliant
SMTP server (such as <tt>qmail-smtpd</tt>) and extends it with STARTTLS
capability.
</p>

<p>
 <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> provides no TLS on its own;
instead, it expects to be run under a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150311223933/http://www.suspectclass.com/sgifford/ucspi-tls/ucspi-tls.txt">UCSPI-TLS</a>
server, and interfaces with it.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     smtpd-starttls-proxy-io <em>smtpd...</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> forks and the parent execs into <em>smtpd...</em>.
<tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> sticks around as a child process. </li>
 <li> <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> interposes itself between the client connection
(stdin/stdout) and <em>smtpd</em>; the latter still talks to its stdin/stdout but those
are only connected to <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt>. </li>
 <li> <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> acts as an SMTP server to the client, and as
an SMTP client to the server. It advertises STARTTLS capability to the client in addition
to <em>smtpd</em>'s capabilities. </li>
 <li> If it receives a <tt>STARTTLS</tt> command, it triggers the UCSPI-TLS process to
perform a TLS handshake, then execs into
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-ioconnect.html">s6-ioconnect</a>, transmitting
data between the TLS layer and <em>smtpd</em> until the end of the connection. </li>
 <li> If, instead, it receives a <tt>HELO</tt> command, which indicates lack of STARTTLS
support in the client, or a <tt>MAIL</tt> command, which indicates a desire to send mail
without requiring TLS, it deactivates the UCSPI-TLS process, then execs into
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-ioconnect.html">s6-ioconnect</a>, this time
transmitting plaintext data between the network and <em>smtpd</em> until the end of the
connection. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Environment variables </h2>

<p>
 <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> expects to be run under a UCSPI-TLS server such as
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-ucspitlsd.html">s6-ucspitlsd</a> or
<a href="//www.fehcom.de/ipnet/ucspi-ssl/sslserver.html">sslserver -n</a>. As a
consequence, it expects its environment to contain the following variables:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> SSLCTLFD: the file descriptor number of the UCSPI-TLS control socket </li>
 <li> SSLREADFD: the file descriptor number of the pipe used to read data from the TLS tunnel after it has been activated </li>
 <li> SSLWRITEFD: the file descriptor number of the pipe used to write data to the TLS tunnel after it has been activated. </li>
</ul>

<p>
 <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> will refuse to run if one of these variables
is nonexistent or contains invalid data.
</p>

<h2> Usage example </h2>

<p>
 You can run a STARTTLS-enabled <tt>qmail-smtpd</tt> mail receiver on
address <em>hostip</em> port <em>port</em> with the following steps:
</p>

<ul>
 <li> Install <a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/index.html">s6-networking</a>
and make sure to activate TLS support. (bearssl is recommended over libtls.) </li>
 <li> Define proper environment variables for your TLS connection: at least
CERTFILE and KEYFILE. The environment you need is documented on the
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tlsd-io.html">s6-tlsd-io</a> page. </li>
 <li> Refine your security with additional environment variables: TLS_UID and TLS_GID to
avoid running the TLS engine as root, and UID and GID to avoid running the SMTP server (and
<tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt>!) as root. </li>
 <li> If you wish, also refine the following command line with various options to every tool
that appears, for fine tuning of connection parameters. </li>
 <li> The following command line is only <em>one</em> command line, which makes heavy use
of chainloading. It has been broken down into several lines for readability.
(Note that you don't need the backslashes if you're writing an
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a> script.) </li>
</ul>

<pre> s6-tcpserver -- <em>hostip</em> <em>port</em> \
  s6-tcpserver-access -Dl0 -t5000 -- \
  s6-ucspitlsd -K30000 -- \
  s6-applyuidgid -Uz -- \
  smtpd-starttls-proxy-io \
  qmail-smtpd </pre>

<ul>
 <li> <a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver.html">s6-tcpserver</a>
will listen on socket TCP:<em>hostip</em>:<em>port</em> and spawn the rest of its
command line as a child for every client connection. (Think <tt>inetd</tt>-like.) </li>
 <li> <a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access</a>
will fine-tune some TCP parameters of the connection. It can also do ip-based access
control, and that's its main use, but that's not what we're using it for here. </li>
 <li> <a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-ucspitlsd.html">s6-ucspitlsd</a>
will create a control channel for opportunistic TLS and wait for a command. </li>
 <li> <a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6/s6-applyuidgid.html">s6-applyuidgid</a> will
drop root privileges. </li>
 <li> <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> will exchange data with the client and the server,
and depending on what the client wants, tell
<a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-ucspitlsd.html">s6-ucspitlsd</a>
either to drop it entirely or to perform a TLS handshake. </li>
 <li> <a href="http://qmail.org/man/man8/qmail-smtpd.html">qmail-smtpd</a> is the
real SMTP server, does nothing else than speak SMTP to its stdin/stdout, does not support
STARTTLS, and is blissfully unaware of all the plumbing and shenanigans that happen
above. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <tt>smtpd-starttls-proxy-io</tt> is significantly less polite than <tt>qmail-smtpd</tt>
when the client does not follow proper protocol. </li>
</ul>
